# Scripts

This repository contains a collection of various scripts, templates, and
one-liners that I use on a regular basis. I've decided to create this repository
because I am tired of losing my scripts ![](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/652079/1) but I hope these may help someone
in the future.

FULL DISCLAIMER: I am no more than an amateur programmer (for now). Please do
not use these scripts without first auditing the code for yourself!

These scripts come with absolutely no warranty. I am not responsible for any
damage caused by these scripts--especially when misused.
